task 1: search for occurances of chars in strings
| a is +1
| b is -1
| n is where the comparison is made

---------------------------------------------

task2: a 2D array of values are given (pass as single into function) 
| take the values from 10-100
| with the values calculate mean, max, min, sum (of the filtered values)

---------------------------------------------

task3: x is a sting input 
| y is a number input to divide the the sting into equal parts
| y must divide x equally
| duplicates are removed to have only unique of the chars left

substact this input from every element of the result array 

---------------------------------------------

task5: x is string input if a char occurs more than once the duplicates are removed and TOTAL count is appended
(uniques get 1 after them)
